### Naıve Bayes
Syntax:

python SentimentAnalysisNaiveBayes.pydata.csv “data.csv” 

requires two columns: Phrase and Sentiment. The sentiment values don’t need to be any specific values. 0-4, positive/negative, or any other values will work. This requires NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/) to be installed. When the program is run, NLTK may prompt you to download additional components.

### Neural Network
Syntax: python SentimentAnalysisCNN0-4.py

This requires NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/), Keras (https://keras.io/), and TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) to be installed. It also requires the’glove.6B.300d.txt’GloVe file (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).When the program is run, it may prompt you to download additional components. 

Syntax: python SentimentAnalysisCNNPosNeg.py

This requires NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/), Keras (https://keras.io/), and TensorFlow(https://www.tensorflow.org/) to be installed. It also requires the ’glove.6B.300d.txt’ GloVe file (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). When the program is run, it may prompt you to download additional components.
